I've written various command additions that makes my life easier while using 
my Ubuntu installation. 


1.  Check if eth0 is connected. 
	I like gnome notify that pops up on your screen 
	Wrote a small script and associated keyboard shortcut
	This script checks to see if eth0 is connected by running 
	ifconfig and checks the return value for assigned IP address.
